# Xdesign Space-X Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

* **`yarn start`:** Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* **`yarn test`:** Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* **`yarn build`:** Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* **`yarn eject`:** **Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!
